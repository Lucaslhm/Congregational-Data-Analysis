## Abstract

The Congregational Data Analysis and Visualization Project was conceived as a means to systematically analyze and visualize the collective sentiments and ideas gathered from the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of New River Valley's listening circles. These circles aimed to discern a unifying ministry project by soliciting individual beliefs, perceived strengths, fears, and weaknesses within the congregation. By transcribing the discussions into a digital format, we employed data analysis techniques and network visualization tools to represent the intricate web of shared thoughts, revealing the congregation's inner dynamics and core concerns.

## Introduction

The Unitarian Universalist Congregation of New River Valley undertook a reflective and inclusive approach to identify a ministry project that resonates with its community's values and aspirations. Through a series of listening circles, the congregation delved into reflective discussions, yielding a rich dataset of individual thoughts and group consensus. The ensuing analytical process, detailed in this report, transcends mere quantitative assessment, venturing into the realm of qualitative interpretation to visualize the nuanced interplay of ideas and emotions.

This report chronicles the journey from data collection through to the visualization, offering a window into the congregation's heart and mind. It is structured as follows:

- **Data Collection**: This section describes the methodology behind gathering responses during the listening circles and the subsequent transcription process.

- **Data Preparation**: Here, we detail the steps taken to convert raw data into a format suitable for analysis, including data cleaning and tagging.

- **Network Generation**: We explain the techniques used to construct a network graph that represents the relationships between different ideas and themes within the data.

- **Visualization**: This section elaborates on the visualization process, including the design decisions and the tools used to bring the data to life visually.

- **Analysis**: We delve into the insights gleaned from the visualizations, discussing the implications and the narratives they reveal about the congregation's collective consciousness.

- **Conclusion**: The report concludes with a synthesis of findings and reflections on the project's implications for the congregation's decision-making process.

- **Reproducing the Analysis**: For those interested in replicating our work or adapting the methodology for their own analysis, this section provides a guide, highlighting potential biases and considerations for ensuring robust and reproducible results.

Through this comprehensive exploration, we not only shed light on the specific queries of our congregation but also demonstrate a replicable model for community engagement and decision-making.


## Data Collection

The Congregational Data Analysis and Visualization Project commenced with a structured approach to data collection, integral to understanding the collective conscience of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of New River Valley. This process was realized through three meticulously planned listening circles. These sessions were designed to facilitate open dialogue, inviting congregation members to articulate their visions for potential ministry projects, reflect on the congregation's strengths, and voice any concerns or fears they harbored.

### Methodology

The listening circles were scheduled as follows:

- **In-Person Session 1**: October 15, 2023
- **Virtual Session (Zoom)**: October 16, 2023
- **In-Person Session 2**: October 17, 2023

#### Structure of Listening Circles

Each listening circle followed a carefully curated agenda to ensure an organized flow and comprehensive participation:

1. **Opening**: Each session began with a chalice lighting to set a reflective tone and included introductions to foster a sense of community.
2. **Covenant and Mission Reminder**: A brief reminder of the congregational covenant and mission statement was provided to align the session with the congregation's values and vision.
3. **Facilitated Discussion**: The bulk of the session was dedicated to a facilitated discussion, guided by a set of predetermined questions and open dialogue.
4. **Documentation**: Attendees' input, gathered through various means, was meticulously documented to capture the essence of each response.
5. **Conclusion**: Each listening circle concluded with a summation of insights, expressions of gratitude, and a brief overview of the next steps.

#### Questions Posed During Listening Circles

During the listening circles, three principal questions guided the discourse, each aimed at unraveling different facets of the congregation's collective psyche:

1. **Ideas**: 
   - "What area of need do you feel drawn to serve?"
   - "What group, issue, or specific ministry project do you think should be our focus?"

2. **Strengths/Gifts**: 
   - "What do we have to give?"
   - "What are our congregation's relevant strengths, gifts, and areas of abundance?"

3. **Concerns/Fears**: 
   - "What are our congregation's relevant fears or concerns?"
   - "About what are we worried or uncertain?"

Each question was designed to elicit responses that, when aggregated, would provide a comprehensive picture of the congregation's values, capabilities, and apprehensions.


#### Setting and Atmosphere

Each session provided a supportive environment where participants could freely express their views. The in-person sessions utilized physical sticky notes for response recording, whereas the virtual session on Zoom utilized the digital tool [Jameboard](https://support.google.com/jamboard/answer/7424836?hl=en) to emulate the experience. After sharing their initial thoughts on sticky notes, participants were invited to elaborate on their responses, fostering a rich group discussion that yielded deeper insights.

#### Documentation Process

In both settings, facilitators documented the discussions, capturing key points, recurring themes, and unique perspectives. The documentation process was comprehensive, involving:

- Taking pictures of the sticky notes
- Saving chat logs from the virtual session
- Compiling attendance lists and total number of participants
- Taking detailed notes during discussions

The meticulous documentation ensured that no aspect of the conversation was lost in translation during subsequent stages of data processing.

### Ethical Considerations

To uphold the integrity of the data collection process, several ethical considerations were observed:

- Ensuring confidentiality and the option for anonymity during data sharing
- Creating a non-judgmental atmosphere where all views were respected
- Adhering to the congregational covenant and mission statement to foster a space of respect and kindness
